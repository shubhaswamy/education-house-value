Examining The Impact Of Education Levels On House Values In American Cities 

This paper explores the impact of various education levels on the house values across cities in the united states.  To explore this relationship, I use a variety of regression models to analyze the impact of education on house values while also accounting for household income as a control variable. Overall, the results suggest that higher levels of education are related to higher house values. By decomposing the sample into those who possess a college degree and those who donâ€™t, the results show that those who have a college degree tend to have higher home values than those who do not.
